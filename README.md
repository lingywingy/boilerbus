# BoilerBus

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for real-time Purdue University bus tracking. View nearby stops, live ETAs, bus locations on an interactive map, and get walking directions.

I really dislike the official bus app, so I decided to make my own. It seemed like they intentionally designed it to be as confusing and slow to navigate as possible, and you had to use your Purdue login just to see where the bus is. 

Fortunately, the API endpoints for bus tracking and route info do not require any authentication to poll, and after some poking around, I was able to figure it out.

## API Info

need to update placeholder once i write the docs wiki page
If you'd like to make your own project that pulls data from Purdue's campus transit network, you can find details on the Liftango API [placeholder](here).

## Development/Self-Hosting Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the CORS Proxy (Required)

The Liftango API doesn't allow cross-origin requests, so you need a proxy. Cloudflare Workers offers a generous free tier (100k requests/day).

1. Sign up at [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (free)
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Create Worker**
3. Name your worker (e.g., `purdue-transit-proxy`)
4. Replace the default code with the contents of [`cloudflare-worker.js`](cloudflare-worker.js)
5. Click **Save and Deploy**
6. Note your worker URL: `https://purdue-transit-proxy.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`

#### Optional: Add Rate Limiting

To protect your proxy from abuse:

1. In your worker, go to **Settings** > **Variables**
2. Click **Add binding** under Rate Limiting
3. Name: `RATE_LIMITER`
4. Configure: 100 requests per 60 seconds
5. Save

### 2. Configure the App

Edit [`config.js`](config.js) and set your CORS proxy URL:

```javascript
var APP_CONFIG = {
    CORS_PROXY_URL: 'https://purdue-transit-proxy.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev',
    // ... other settings
};
```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `config.js` with your worker URL
3. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
4. Set source: **Deploy from a branch** > **main** > **/ (root)**
5. Save - your app will be live at `https://lingywingy.github.io/BoilerBus/`

## Local Development

For local development, you don't need to configure a CORS proxy. The included Python server handles proxying:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lingywingy/BoilerBus.git
cd BoilerBus

# Start the development server
python server.py

# Open in browser
# http://localhost:8085
```

The local server includes a built-in CORS proxy, so leave `CORS_PROXY_URL` empty in `config.js` for local development.
